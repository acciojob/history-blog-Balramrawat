    <p>The tomb first came to light in 2022 when archaeologists with the Superintendence of Archaeology, Fine Arts and Landscape of Southern Etruria were exploring cavities that had opened in an agricultural field near Tarquinia. Archaeospeleologists lowered themselves into the cavities to explore and found Etruscan chamber tombs. They had already been looted in antiquity, but one of tombs contained a hidden treasure: a second, deeper chamber tomb behind its collapsed left wall.</p>

    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>The left wall is the best preserved. It contains scenes of four dancers, two men and two women, dancing energetically around a flautist. The paintings on the back wall were damaged by collapsing stone, but they appear to depict the figure of a woman and two young men. The right wall is thickly encrusted with chalky coatings, but even obscured the subject matter is striking.</p>
